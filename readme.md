# ClassicCraft+
> ClassicCraft+ offers a refreshing twist on the traditional Minecraft survival experience. Immerse yourself in a world of revamped biomes and a tougher challenge to defeat the dragon, while staying true to vanilla Minecraft.

## World Generation
The world generation has been completely redesigned without adding any new blocks, by the mods of StardustLabs!
The dimensions have new structures and the end is finally as hard as it should be!

## Bosses
The Ender Dragon is finally actually hard, thanks to the Ender Dragon Fights Remastered mod.
No more speedrunning with an iron armor!

This modpack also adds a the 'Hovering Inferno', which requires an absurd amount of preparation and jumps in as the hardest boss in the game.

## Utility
The modpack includes a handful of utilities such as Freelook, Xaero's Mini/WorldMap and Mouse Wheelie.
Additionally, it contains numerous quality of life improvements that balance and enhance the game.

### Other
The modpack in its current state only exists since version v4.0.0. The older versions do not fit this description at all.
