# ClassicCraft+
> ClassicCraft+ offers a refreshing twist on the traditional Minecraft survival experience. Immerse yourself in a world of revamped biomes and a tougher challenge to defeat the dragon, while staying true to vanilla Minecraft.

## World Generation
The world generation is slightly redesigned by the mods of bebebea_loste.
The dimensions have new structures and the end is finally as hard as it should be.

## Bosses
The Ender Dragon is finally the hardest boss in the game, thanks to the Ender Dragon Fights Remastered mod.
No more speedrunning with an iron armor!

## Utility
The modpack includes a handful of utilities such as Freelook, Xaero's Mini/WorldMap and Mouse Wheelie.
